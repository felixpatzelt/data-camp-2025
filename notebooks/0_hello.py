    # Welcome to Data-Camp 2025

    We use marimo notebooks, which allow you to explore data interactively using the tools that the [Python](https://python.org) ecosystem has to offer! üßë‚Äçüî¨üìä

    - A notebook contains cells that either contain [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or Python code. 
    - Every cell has a little "play" symbol ‚ñ∂Ô∏é that will run the cell, i.e. execute the commands within. 
    - You can also click into a cell and press `shift + enter` on your keyboard to run the cell and continue to the next one.
